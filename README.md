# imunes-security
Examples of security scenarios in IMUNES.

IMUNES is a lightweight network emulator that runs on top of the FreeBSD kernel
which is used to create a virtual network topology by using FreeBSD
[jails](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html) and
[netgraph](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?netgraph%284%29).

All presented scenarios run on in the IMUNES virtual machine that can be
downloaded from: http://www.imunes.net/dl/IMUNES_security.ova.

To run the scenarios, after starting the virtual machine, just clone the git
repository into the machine and follow the instructions.
